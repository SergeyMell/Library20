  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  root 'users#show'

  get 'attach_files' => 'migration#attach_files'
  post 'attach_files' => 'migration#attach_files_action'

  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable


  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end
